This project is part of my larger ambition to design a fully autonomous “dark factory” a production environment where every process, from material entry to automated billing, operates without human intervention. This phase focuses on connecting Siemens TIA Portal with cloud analytics tools. 

## 🚀 Features
- Autonomous production line simulation  
- PLC programming for safety and efficiency  
- Digital twin integration with Factory I/O  
- Example of Industry 4.0 / Smart Factory concepts  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Siemens TIA Portal (S7-1500 PLC)  
- Factory I/O  
- OPC UA / Industrial communication  

## 📂 Project Files
- PLC project files (TIA Portal)  
- Factory I/O simulation file  
- Documentation & diagrams
